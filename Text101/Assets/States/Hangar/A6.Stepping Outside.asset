    just need to realise that they are interrupting some of my precious sleep.\n\nI
    step outside and they all look at me. I can barely see their faces... It's so
    dark...\n\n\"Hey guys, I am your neighbour and just wanted to kindly ask you to
    keep it down a little, I am trying to sleep\"\n\nHmmm... They don't seem to care...
    I will repeat it a little louder in case they didn't hear me.\n\n\"Guys! Could
    you keep it down please?\"\n\nAll of a sudden they all walk towards me.\n\nWhat
    shall I do?\n 1 - Close the door"
