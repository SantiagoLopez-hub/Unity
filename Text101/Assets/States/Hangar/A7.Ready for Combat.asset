    is what they want. I don't care. I AM A MAN!\n\nHeart is going fast, an empty
    glass bottle on my hand and many against me.\n\nDoor is now open but, what...
    what are they do doing? Their hands are sticking out, trying to reach for me.
    They are making strange noises. My mind is null but I can still make a decision.\nAre
    they infected?\n\nWhat shall I do?\n 1 - Wait to find out\n 2 - Close the door"
